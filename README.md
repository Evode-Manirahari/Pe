## 🌱 What is Pe?

**Pe is an AI-powered Health Operating System for ALL physicians** — from family medicine to oncology, cardiology to pediatrics. It helps clinicians stay emotionally present and connected with their patients, while reducing administrative overload and missed follow-ups.

It's not just another AI scribe — it's a **compassion-aware care companion** that turns routine clinical work into human moments again, **regardless of specialty**.

### The Problem

- **43-48%** of U.S. physicians report burnout symptoms (AMA, 2025)
- Doctors spend **2 hours on clerical work** for every hour of patient time
- **15%** of follow-up care tasks are missed, increasing hospitalizations and mortality
- Healthcare has become faster but not kinder

### The Solution

Pe combines three core innovations:

1. **PeNote** — Empathic AI documentation with emotional cue detection
2. **PeLoop** — Care continuity tracker that ensures no patient falls through the cracks
3. **PeBridge** *(Roadmap)* — Patient connection app with personalized, human-toned engagement
